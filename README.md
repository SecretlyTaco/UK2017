# UK2017
An awful messy hack to scrape BBCs website for UK 2017 election results

Created quickly to read the UK election results from BBCs (incredibly heavy) website and output a small text file that I can load on mobile data :)  
See output at [loki.sockspls.com/2017](https://loki.sockspls.com/2017)

Update: In case something breaks and it can't output, it looked like this
```
+---------------------------+-------+
|           Party           | Seats |
+---------------------------+-------+
|        Conservative       |  318  |
|           Labour          |  262  |
|  Scottish National Party  |   35  |
|      Liberal Democrat     |   12  |
| Democratic Unionist Party |   10  |
|           Others          |   13  |
